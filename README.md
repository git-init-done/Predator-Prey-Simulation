# Predator-Prey-Simulation
A Java-based simulation that models a simple predator-prey ecosystem on a 2D grid, featuring Doodlebugs (X) and Ants (o). This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and algorithmic behavior through dynamic interaction between species, governed by movement, breeding, and survival rules.
